Project by Isaac Elam Wennekamp

This is a website for my game development group, Clueless Morning Chicken. It contains a little bit of information about our group, and games in progress. It also has a way to contact us and join our news letter.

The navbar contains the logo, a link to our games and a dropdown. The logo is the "home" button. It will take you back to the top of the main page from anywhere in the site. The "Our Games" link will take you to the page displaying our games. 
Finally, the dropdown "Other" has two options, the first, "About Us" takes you to the bottom of the main page where the small description of our group is displayed.
The second, "Contact Us" takes you to the contact page where you can write us a message that will be delievered using form.io. The search bar was automatically implemented by Bootstrap so I do not full understand it's capabilities yet and since I didn't write the code for it I do not want to take credit for it's usefulness.

I used HTML5 CSS3 And Bootstrap 4 in this project.

Future improvement:
    I would like th carousel to be more friendly towards smaller screens, currently the carousel scales but the images do not.
    The color pallet and general style could probably be improved, right now it is very bright and hard to look at for a long time.
    There may be too many different font sizes througout the site which could be improved if it is an issue.
